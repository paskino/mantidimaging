Jupyter Notebooks Tutorial
==========================

There are 2 Jupyter Notebooks that show off how the package works. They require
having a working setup of :code:`mantidimaging` in the :code:`~/mantidimaging`
directory.

Easiest way to do that would be to do a :code:`git clone
https://github.com/mantidproject/mantidimaging` while in the Home (:code:`~`)
directory. The paths are being setup inside the notebook at runtime, usually in
the first few blocks of code.

The notebook files are located in :code:`mantidimaging/docs/notebooks` folder.
They require that `Jupyter Notebook` is installed, which should be, if using
Anaconda's python distribution.

To start a notebook go into the :code:`mantidimaging/notebooks` directory and
run with :code:`jupyter notebook`. This will start a local server and will open
the notebook in the browser.

They are a brief introduction to the steps in a reconstruction, and explain some
of the terms. However they were used during a presentation, so some things might
be missing as text.
